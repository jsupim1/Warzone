This mod makes it so that each army requires X gold of upkeep per turn.

For this mod to work, Commerce should be enabled.
To make Gold just like normal income, go to Armies, tick Commerce, untick Army Cost Multiplier and untick Can Build Cities.

Gold has to be used as that is currently the only form of currency that mods can override.
